## Conceptual development ##

### Design intent ###
<!--- Include your design intent here. It should be about a 10 word phrase/sentence. --->
A device that conveys the beauty/simplicity of plants that makes us think how we look at plants to shape our lives.

I wanted to draw from some characteristics of plants; their slow growth, simple processes/beauty and limited elements to live.

### Design ideation ###
<!--- Document your ideation process. This will include the design concepts presented for assessment 2. You can copy and paste that information here. --->
I started with 3 general ideas for this project, these made up the basics of my finished project.

My first design concept was to create a flower/plant that grew when a light turned on and a watering can was moved towards it. I would create this with a light sensor catching the light going to a motor to lift the flower out of a hole. As well as a radio embedded in the watering can to lift the flower or make it spread out more. 

My second design invloved a flower bed and the 3 stages of a plant growing; seeds, seedlings and flowers. Light sensors over certain areas would trigger the different stages of growth to appear from the flower bed, showing the beauty in each stage of growth. This could be done in a smaller scale to compensate for the lack of resources. 

My final design was to create a flower that blooms with light. It involves a light sensor recieving light which triggers a motor to pull open the flower. My design would be simple and beautiful to reflect the simplicity of nature.

![IMG_6875](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62362612/79945124-83e2a280-84b0-11ea-8924-952087bdd326.JPG)

### Final design concept ###
<!--- This should be a description of your concept including its context, motivation, or other relevant information you used to decide on this concept. --->
My finished design concept was to create a flower/a bunch of flower that bloom when a sensor recieves light. A servo motor pulled strings attached to the flowers, to make them bloom.

### Interaction flowchart ###
<!--- Include an interaction flowchart of the interaction process in your project. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible. --->

## Process documentation ##

I started my experimentation with making the coding. To let the phototransistor recieve the light to go through the micro bit and trigger a servo motor move to push open the flower. So I started with combining the code from my previous project, the self waterer plant and the phototransistor experiment in the book. I took the end of the code of the self plant waterer, where it makes the motor move and the start of the code using the transistor to recieve the light. 
I wasn't sure whether it would work at the begining, but I started to experiment with this. 

Using a light sensor and analog inputs experiment;

![using a light sensor and analog inputs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62362612/79946047-8a721980-84b2-11ea-9d47-cb14cbadd84d.png)

Plant waterer code;

![Plant waterer code](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62362612/79946064-92ca5480-84b2-11ea-894f-c39bfbaf31ba.png)

First code test;

![Bloom test 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62362612/79946776-fbfe9780-84b3-11ea-8e7d-f4763ffdbcc0.png)


Making small adjustments, I figured out that the code worked through the microbit, using the inbuilt light sensor rather than the one I attached it to. I managed to find the right timing for the motor to spin, fast when the light was first recieved and a large gap before it moved back so the flower bloomed for at least 10 seconds. I also found out through my different tests that it didn't work as well when it was connected to my computer, but better when I connected it to the battery.

I added a moon when there wasn't any light present and a sun when there was, so I could see what was happening. 

By test no.6, I realised that the smallest amount of light I had for the motor to move wasn't right, it was too low. So I played around with it, as I didn't fully understand how it made a different. I found that 200 was too low, after changing it to 500, I found it was too high. 300 was the golden number, It worked with my torch on my phone as well as some bright house lights. 

At this point, I was close to finally cracking the problem, I still hadn't worked out if it could work with my phototransistor yet, it was working when I made contact with pin 1 though. I connected my light sensor and played around with the positioning of the aligator clips on the pin and the microbit. I figured out that it worked when the shorter side of the pin was connected to pin 1 and the other to 0. 

![bloom test 6 (final)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62362612/79946108-a5dd2480-84b2-11ea-8c44-683969b7a052.png)

My circuit had finally worked and operated swiftly. The phototransistor recieved the light from my torch then successfully madde the motor move 1 sec after then stay at that angle for 10 seconds then move back to its original position.

![IMG_6868](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62362612/79945215-affe2380-84b0-11ea-9a17-182f2c9ecd73.JPG)

At this point I had to rethink my idea, keeping my current coding that I had. When I went back to make the curcuit again, I had trouble getting it to work the same way. 

One thing I changed was the icons of the sun and moon to a sad face when there was no light and a happy one when there was. I thought this would help it give the plant emotion. 

![bloom test 7 (smiley)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62362612/82560406-c3d29d80-9bb4-11ea-888f-cab639b10d20.png)

After some slight adjusments to the amounts of light accepted by the phototransistor and the sensitivity, I found a code I thought that worked.

![Bloom test 11 (final)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62362612/82560448-d77e0400-9bb4-11ea-9588-087967924115.png)

However, this was false hope. As later I tested out putting my microbit, motor, phototransistor and the alligator clips into the pot that was going to hold it, I found that the curcuit stopped working. The alligator clips were very unreliable, setting off the curcuit when there was no light. After switching alligator clips to a new one, I found it also did the same after some time. 

I looked for other options instead of alligator clips, such as other clips or a breadboard, but due to lack of time and resources, I decided to compromise and take out the phototransistor, therefore the faulty clips.

I stripped back the coding and went back to the experiment with the phototransistor, but converting it to using the microbit light sensor instead.

![in-built light sensor](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62362612/82560516-f11f4b80-9bb4-11ea-93e4-dab7212da96b.png)

After this, I added on the previous coding for the servo motor, through the servo options that I also discovered at the time.

![Final](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62362612/82560484-e49af300-9bb4-11ea-801e-9f46220ec02c.png)

In the process of figuring out my code, I also worked on the fabrication of my project.

I started off making the flowers. I wanted to design a flower that was bright and beautiful. I am a big fan of yellow, so I decided to go with Yellow flowers.

I found a video of someone making an origami flower, similar to a cocktail umbrella. I saw that this design could work for mine, with the motor pulling the bottom tab that pulled the petals of the flower, therefore making it bloom. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_Bm20XjMU

I then created a protoype of it to make sure I understood how it could work with my flower. 

![IMG_6867](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62362612/79945291-cdcb8880-84b0-11ea-9827-3a45d1ec2ba1.JPG)

It worked theoretically, I just had to find a way of making it work practically, connecting the bottom tab to the servo motor. I saw a flaw with the fragility of the paper compared with the rapid movement of the motor an considered using a stronger material so it could move with the motor and withstand the force that it gave.

I then looked to other designs to see their processes, I saw a project that was very similar to mine and after some feedback from others, I decided to chnage my design and interaction of my project, but leaving the coding, using it in a different way.

After this brief pause to reassess my design, I decided to stay with the flowers and place them in a pot. This would serve as a place to hold my curcuit as well as making my project more mobile. I also decided to not just have one flower, but a few all blooming at the same time. I would also add a hole in the pot to show the screen of the microbit, a smiley and a sad face at the appropriate time.

I figured out all the materials that I needed to pull it off.

I had completed the flowers, made out of fake petals glued on painted paper straws, then a rolled orange paper centre, then adding a sliding tab connected by longer tabs to give it movement.

![IMG_7372](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62362612/82561983-b66ae280-9bb7-11ea-8bc0-84e32225635e.JPG)

![IMG_7390](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62362612/82562024-c71b5880-9bb7-11ea-81e9-ae9ba892d15e.JPG)

They worked successfully, and I believed they would be strong enough for the motor.

I then proceeded in cutting the hole in the pot for the microbit screen.

image

After this, I placed the the circuit in the pot. I realised at this point that the alligator clips were faulty and unreliable so I changed my code to another solution, using the light sensor in the microbit. This meant I was much more successful when placing the microbit and motor in my pot.

Image

For the next part of the flowers, I attached string to the tabs of the flowers then to a slip that would evetually be glued to the arm on my servo motor. Meaning the arm would pull all the tabs in unison, so all the flowers could bloom. 

Image

This took a couple of tries, but managed to fit the mirobit in, using blu-tak to hold it against the wall and also for holding the servo motor down. The flowers also had blu-tak to hold them in place.

That was the completion of my project.
